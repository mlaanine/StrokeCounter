# StrokeCounter
Android app and Arduino paddle attached gadget to count paddle strokes for kayakers.

This is something I didn't see on the market, so I made one myself.  I used an Arduino Pro Mini and 
a BlueSMiRF attached to the paddle shaft to count paddle strokes (so far detected with position switches,
next updgrade will use a MEMS sensor).

As it is, the app shows stroke count, elapsed time and average cadence.
