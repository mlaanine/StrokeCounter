# StrokeCounter
Android app and Arduino paddle attached gadget to count paddle strokes for kayakers.

This is something I didn't see on the market, so I made one myself.  I use an Arduino Pro Mini and 
a BlueSMiRF attached to the paddle shaft to count paddle strokes (so far detected with position switches,
next updgrade will use a MEMS sensor).

Included is also a SketchUp 3D file for printing out a frame for the PCBs - they need to be wired up and
supplied with power as best as you can.  I bought a 4xAAA battery holder and printed the frame with an
Ultimaker2.  #Todo waterproof mechanics, these you can stuff in a waterproof pouch and strap it to the paddle.

As it is, the app shows stroke count, elapsed time and average cadence.
